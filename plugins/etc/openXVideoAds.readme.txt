The IAB VAST Plugin enables you to set up, deliver and track video ads in accordance with the IAB Digital Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) standard.

The plugin supports the following types of video ads: inline video ads and overlay video ads.
 - Inline video ads include pre/mid/post-roll ads which take over the full view of the video.
 - Overlay video ads include text or banners appearing within the video frame which click to initiate another video or to open a website.

The video plugin also supports the display of up to one companion banner per video ad.

Feature requests Video Plugin
=============================
- Currently, if you create a video banner, you can link it to a HTML zone that has *x* dimensions; this however doesn't make sense and the video won't serve. Requesting this non-video zone from the flowplayer will just fail in some ways. Ideally, we should ensure that video banners are only linked to video zones (by design, Revive Adserver enforces zone linking by dimensions rather than type, so I think this is not easily possible?)
- Please email us with your ideas or suggestions
- Add a "Expand all"
- Video banners should have the right icons, instead of the generic html banner icons
- In video reports, a row should not be expandable if there is no data
- Add a message when no event were recorded yet: "It appears that no Video Events were recorded in the table %s"
- Add name of the reported item in the stats page, eg. "Advertiser Video Report for [advertiser name]"; Note that this usability issue is also true for all existing reports in OXP
