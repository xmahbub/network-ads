v1.6.0
    * Added an experimental parameter to enable users to add a skip button to
      the video playback after a specified number of seconds. Add
      "&skipoffset=N" to the vast2 url, with N being the number of seconds for
      the Skip button to appear once video ad playback has started. Many video
      players will accept the skip offset, even when it is not an official

      visible in the video ad statistics.
